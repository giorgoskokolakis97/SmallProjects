#SmallProjects
Overview
This GitHub repository contains code and reports for five distinct data science projects. Each project is organized into its own branch, focusing on a specific aspect of analysis or prediction. 
Below is a brief description of each project and the corresponding branch:

1. Sentiment Analysis on Real and Fake News of Twitter
Branch: sentiment-analysis-twitter-news

Abstract— This big data programming project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for detecting fake news and predicting the sentiment of tweets.
          The project will use two datasets of tweets that have been labeled with their authenticity and sentiment, respectively. 
          The CNN model will be trained on these datasets using deep learning techniques, with the goal of applying it on a different tweet dataset, in order to gain insights about current political events. 
          The project will also utilize big data technologies, such as Tensorflow, to efficiently process and analyze the substantial amounts of data.

2. Flower Image Classification Using CNN
Branch: flower-image-classification

Abstract—  In this paper, we present a system for classifying images of flowers using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 
           The system is trained and tested on a dataset of images of flowers, where each image is labeled with the species of flower it depicts. 
           We evaluate the performance of the system using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. 
           Our system achieves high accuracy in classifying images of flowers, demonstrating the effectiveness of CNNs in this task. 
           Overall, the proposed system is a valuable tool for automating the identification of flower species, which can have applications in fields such as conservation, agriculture, and research. 
           Additionally, the findings in this paper could be extend to other image classification tasks such as plant recognition in general.

3. Building a Short-term Forecasting Model to Predict the Call Volume of an Answering Service Company
Branch: call-volume-forecasting

Abstract— This project focuses on time series forecasting for call volume prediction in a call answering company. 
          Four different models, namely XGBoost, RNN, SARIMAX, and SVR, were employed to assess their predictive capabilities and performance. 
          The study utilised a dataset consisting of 2,783,712 incoming call records from January 1st to December 31st, 2022, encompassing 14 call groups. 
          Evaluation metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and MAE were utilised to compare the models.
          The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the models in accurately forecasting call volumes. 
          XGBoost achieved an MSE of 0.002, RMSE of 0.04, and MAE of 0.03, indicating a high level of accuracy and a close alignment with the observed data. 
          The RNN model performed similarly well, with a MSE of 0.00005, RMSE of 0.007, and MAE of 0.005, 
          showcasing its ability to capture underlying patterns in the time series data effectively in the residual analysis;
          as well as its capabilities of outperforming all other models given the necessary resources. 
          On the other hand, the SARIMAX model exhibited a RMSE of 0.039, MSE of 0.0015, and MAE of 0.025, indicating a lower level of accuracy compared to the RNN model but slightly better than XGBoost.
          The SVR model achieved the best results with a RMSE of 0.006, MSE of 0.00004, and MAE of 0.005, highlighting its strong predictive capabilities.
          Limitations, including data availability and computational resources, were acknowledged, suggesting the need for diverse datasets and computational considerations. 
          Future research could explore ensemble and hybrid models, incorporate additional features, and enhance interpretability for improved forecasting accuracy and decision-making. 
          The practical implications of these findings are substantial for call answering companies, enabling efficient resource allocation and enhanced operational efficiency in handling call volumes.

4. Predicting Tourist Flow in Czechia
Branch: tourist-flow-prediction-czechia

Abstract— This project focuses on predicting tourist flows to Czechia from five key countries: Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Russia, and the United States.
          Various forecasting techniques were employed, including Exponential Smoothing (ETS) models, stepwise regression, Lasso and Ridge regression, and Temporal Hierarchies Forecasting (THieF). 
          Evaluations were based on the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and visualization of results. 
          Despite efforts to incorporate IMF economic indicators, predictions remained discouraging, emphasizing the complexity of tourism dynamics and the need for further investigation.
